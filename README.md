# Land of Hop

Node.js back-end for the [React application](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop), basically just REST API to connect with MongoDB. [Previously](https://github.com/tomekrozalski/landofhop-back) I used back-end built in Express JS. Now I would like to give a try to Nest JS. Of course it is still under development ☺️
